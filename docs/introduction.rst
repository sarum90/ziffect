Motivation
----------

The motivation for ``ziffect`` was an inner sensation that
`effect <https://effect.readthedocs.org/>`_ was slightly incomplete, and with the
help of `zope.interface <http://docs.zope.org/zope.interface/>`_ and
`pyrsistent <https://pyrsistent.readthedocs.org/>`_ it could be made a lot
better.

In order to justify this library I will attempt to write the same bit of code
using pure ``Effect`` and using pure ``ziffect``
